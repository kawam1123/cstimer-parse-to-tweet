# cstimer-parse-to-tweet

This is Google Chrome extension for parsing csTimer statistics data and tweeting.

## What is this?
**You can tweet with your daily csTimer statistics (e.g, single, ao5, ao12, etc.) just by clicking the extention icon on Google Chrome.**

This extension automatically generates a text string like below:

```
3x3x3 practice today!

1/5/12/50/100 = 15.80/20.40/21.92/22.30/23.62
```

you can customize:
- statistical indicators of times which appear in the output text
- prefix text before the times.

**Enjoy csTimer!**

## TODO
- apply options from storage.sync.
- get a scramble type of the target session and apply to the text.
